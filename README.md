<h1> AgriTech USGS-LIDAR Challenge </h2>
AgriTech, is very interested in how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help them improve their research on new agricultural products being tested on farms.

<h2> Business Objective </h2>
AgriTech would like to be able to better understand which parts of the farm are likely to produce more or less maize.

**Why?**

So that if they try a new fertilizer on part of this farm, they have more confidence that any differences in the maize harvest are due mostly to the new fertilizer changes, and not just random effects due to other environmental factors.
